Cookies cannot access your personal information, and we do not share information gathered by cookies.</p>
<p>You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. Please be aware that, if you reject the cookie, you will not be able to use our web-based services.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></h3>
<p>We will ask you to provide us with information about yourself when you set up an account on the Site and when you purchase the Product through the Site.</p>
<p>Some of this information will be personal information for the purposes of the Act.</p>

<p>Please note that we only ask for a student identification number when an Educator has instructed us to do so and we are satisfied that this is required to enable your Educator to determine a Student’s progression in relation to the Product.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the course in which you participate and for which you use the Product, we may, with the permission of your Educator, collect data on your course experience and progression, including demographics and academic performance (i.e., marks or grades) for each of the assessment tasks (including exams).</p>

<h3><strong>How we protect information</strong></h3>
<p>We will take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, or destruction. We will retain the information for a reasonable amount of time after your account expires.</p>
